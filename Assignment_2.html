<h1>Assignment 2 Instructions</h1>

Hi guys , I hope that you are enjoying the class so far , here is your second assignment.<br>
In this assignment we are testing how well we understand control flow and how well can we implement it.<br>
We also are testing our version control skills (in this case git ), add , comment , push ,
<br>and merging work from different branches.<br>
And as I reminder , we are here as individuals and our education is our personal responsibility and
<br>plagiarism stands in the way of true development â€¦.. So you know what to do.<br><br>

And remember if there is something that is unclear , please ask me before the deadline.<br>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
<i>Multiple choice trivia</i><br><br>
Create a game that asks the user 10 questions and gives them a choice between two answers ,<br>
After they finish the game , let them know their score and ask them to play again if they say yes <br>till
they say no, then you stop the game .<br>
To get extra marks , you can give them multiple choice by question and count the time,
they take when answering the question , <br>if they answer the question in less that two seconds ,
give them extra credit .<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
this question is graded over 30<br>
Nice indenting 5marks<br>
Nice commenting 5 marks<br>
Code running perfectly 20 marks<br>


<h2>Question 2</h2>
Using a loop, Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs
the number with the digits reversed.<br>
For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.<br>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.<br>
If the user's guess is higher than the random number, the program should display "Too high, try again.<br>
" If the user's guess is lower than the random number, the program should display "Too low, try again."<br>
The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number.<br>
And calculate the number of attempts.<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
this question is graded over 30<br>
Nice indenting 5marks<br>
Nice commenting 5 marks<br>
Code running perfectly 20 marks<br>
Having proper branches is worth 10 marks <br>
Having work well done in the group , ie I see that everyone on their branch have significant work 10 marks <br>
